#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - one operation


b) O(n log n) - nested loops and few different operations


c) O(n) - My note say O(n) because of the use of recursion

## Exercise II

I'd use a binary search to find the best floor to start on.
	get a total count of floors
		start = total floors // 2
		end = 1

		until egg cracks:
			if egg cracks move down:
				start = start // 2
			elif egg doesn't crack move up:
				start = 
				end = start + 1
			elif egg doesn't crack anymore:
				you found the highest floor

Story time:

The day has come! Egg in hand, I stand at the base of the building that is rising into the atmosphere, thinking to myself how high can I go before my egg scrambles on the ground.  Gazing upon the building, I decide to start in the middle. I count how many floors reach to the sky, before aimlessly rushing up countless flights of stairs.  I determined there are 30 floors.  I start out for the 15th floor.  Upon reaching the predetermined floor, I look for a window that can be opened, and reluctantly, I drop my egg.  Watching my egg fall, I wonder "will the parachute save my egg?".  I head back down to the street and find that my egg did not make the plunge.  Don't fret. I have another.  I grab a second tribute and head for the seventh floor, deciding to cut the ascent and fall by half.  Again, reaching the second crash zone, I find an open window and send my tribute on its maiden voyage.  No luck!  It hit the ground and suffered the same fate as the first.  I grab another reluctant egg and ascend a little lower than before, to the third floor.  I drop the egg, it hits the ground, and survives!  Success!  But at what height is my test survival limit reached?  I head to the 5th floor, dropping the egg and heading to the curb.  Only to find that it hasn't made the fall.  The final test is waiting on the fourth floor. Will the egg make it or suffer the same fate as three scrambled eggs before it?
